Mischievously Evil Job Listings
Welcome to the Mischievously Evil Job Listings project! üåê

Introduction
This project is a playful exploration of the intersection between artificial intelligence and dark humor. Using the power of OpenAI's GPT-3, we've created a unique experience that generates fictional job listings for a devilish temp agency run by Satan. The goal? Craft job offers so absurdly unsuitable that even the bravest job seekers would think twice.

Features
Interactive Interview Simulation: Engage in an interactive interview simulation by providing your responses to specific questions. Witness how GPT-3 crafts job listings tailored to your inputs.

Dynamic Job Descriptions: The project dynamically generates job titles, descriptions, annual salaries, and hilariously useless benefits based on user inputs, creating a whimsical and entertaining narrative.

Real-World Application: While the primary aim is entertainment, the generated job listings can serve as creative writing exercises or simply provide a good laugh. Feel free to share your favorite concoctions with the community!
